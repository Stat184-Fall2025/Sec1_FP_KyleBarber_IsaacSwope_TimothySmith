# NFL Data Analysis

Do various data analysis over the years 1999-2022 with multiple statistics for every NFL Team.

## Overview

In our Quarto document we show a scatter plot showing a team's efficiency, a bar graph showing each Teams total wins, and 4 scatter plots each
analyzing how a different statistic influences team wins. Our Quarto also includes 3 different tables. One table that describes team's wins with multiple statistics.
One table describing each teams simple arithmetic mean for wins and defensive and offensive yards. The last table include team's win rate, loss rate, and average
point differential.

### Interesting Insight (Optional)

This is optional but highly recommended. You'll include one interesting insight from your project as part of the README. This insight is most effective when you include a visual. Keep in mind that this visual must be included as an image file (e.g., JPG, PNG, etc.). You can export plots created with `{ggplot2}` by using the function `ggsave`.
