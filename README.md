# NFL Data Analysis

Do various data analysis over the years 1999-2022 with multiple statistics for every NFL Team.

## Overview

In our Quarto document we show a scatter plot showing a team's efficiency, a bar graph showing each Teams total wins, and 4 scatter plots each
analyzing how a different statistic influences team wins. Our Quarto also includes 3 different tables. One table that describes team's wins with multiple statistics.
One table describing each teams simple arithmetic mean for wins and defensive and offensive yards. The last table include team's win rate, loss rate, and average
point differential.

### Interesting Insight (Optional)


One insight that we have noticed is that it is much more important for teams to have a strong rush defense than a strong pass defense as a rush defensive has much more
association with winning that a pass defense. In the Win Association Scatterplot the linear regression is a lot more negative for teams that allowed more rush yards
than teams that allowed more pass yards.
